# Context Managers

Context managers in Python are a great way to manage resources such as file operations or database connections. They provide a way to allocate and release resources precisely when you want to. The most common use case of context managers is the ```with``` keyword in Python.

```python
with open('file.txt', 'r') as f:
    contents = f.read()
```

They can be used with any object that supports the context management protocol, which consists of the ```__enter__``` and ```__exit__``` methods.
